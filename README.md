# VirtualPianoPlayer
An application specifically made for the Virtual Piano Website.

# NOTE! This was a very ambitious project of mine which as of now, is in a state that I am unhappy with and doesn't do all that much. I'll keep it public for people who are curious about how this works, but please know it isn't as cool a program as I want it to be.

# How to Use
Go to the Virtual Piano Website: https://www.onlinepianist.com/virtual-piano

Make sure it is zoomed in and not zoomed out.

Open VirtualPianoBotGUI.py

Make sure it isn't in the way of the keys(Note: There can't be anything blocking the keys otherwise this program will not work.)

Press a key to play a note.

# What are all the files used for
__pycache__ I'm not entirely sure what that does. 

backup.txt is just a backup of all my code

PianoKeys.py is used to store the position of all the piano keys.

PianoSongs.py is used if you want to write a song.(Note: If you want to write a song, you are going to have to write it manually for the time being.)

pyuic5.exe is there so that I could use the PyQt5 designer.

VirtualPianoBot.py is the main file where all the code is run.(Note: If you want to play a song, follow my example in the main file.)

VirtualPianoBotGUI.py is used to make changes to the GUI and also to add new features.

VirtualPianoBotGUI.ui was used to make the simple GUI of the app.

# Things that I need to add

1. Fix the keys.
2. A way to save the keys to the Songs.py file, so that the user doesn't have to add keys to his/her song manually. 
3. ???
